# Spotify Queue App

This project creates a method of queuing songs up using Amazon Alexa. Currently the project functions
as a web page with a text box for queuing songs. Type in a search string and the top hit for that
search will be queued.

In the future, an Alexa skill will hit this apps endpoint with a search string that the user provides.
This will trigger the app to add the song to the current queue.

#Future Ideas

Develop the alexa skill

Currently, when the queue ends it plays the first song in a set playlist. I want to add a feature that plays a random song from a randomly chosen playlist when the queue ends.
